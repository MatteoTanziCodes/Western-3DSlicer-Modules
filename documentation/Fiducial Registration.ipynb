    "#### What is Fiducial Registration?\n",
    "\n",
    "Fidicial registration is and important technique used in image guided surguries. It is the process of applying a rigid transformation technique to a set of localized points (fiducials) in a 3D patient image, in order to register the first set of points to the second set of points. This overall transformation will be applied to the entire image, and non-fiducials or \"targets\" will be used to assess the error. While various applications of fiducial registration use an interoperative coordinate system that generally uses a handheld tracker to physically point to the targets, this application of fiducial registration will use an algorithm that determines the Fiducials and Fiducial targets on each of the imaging systems. While there may be newly developed techniques using deep learning that allow for greater quality image registration, the speed and cost of fiducial registration still makes it a viable tool for image transformation.\n",

    "#### Application of Fiducial Registration:\n",
    "\n",
    "The application of fiducial registration in the context of this project will be to set fiducials using various methodologies, then calculate the target registration error (TRE) which will be placed at the center point of the tumour volume. While error is guarenteed, the technique with minimal error will be applied.\n"

    "#### Rigid Transformations:\n",
    "\n",
    "A rigid body transformation, is one such that the mapping of a set in euclidean space to another subset in the euclidean space such that the euclidean distances between points are preserved. Therefore, after scale adjusting each of the euclidean spaces in the image systems to proportionality, they will use some combination of a rotation, translation and reflections to achieve the desired transformation. Rigid transformations often use a transformation matrix to represent the transformation from one set of points to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proper Rigid Transformations:\n",
    "\n",
    "A proper rigid transformation analyzes certain important characteristics, that ensure that the applied transformation is correct. The determinant of the transformation matrix R, must equal positive one, even if the matrix that equals negative one has less FLE. This is important because it ensure correct reflection and rotation transformations have been applied, and that the properties of rigid transformations are being upheld. Using proper transformations also ensures that there is less TRE.\n",

    "An affine transformation is a geometric transformation that preserves lines and parallelism (but not necessarily distances and angles). Examples of affine transformations include translation, scaling, homothety, similarity, reflection, rotation, shear mapping, and compositions of them in any combination and sequence. \n",

    "#### Fiducial Localization Error (FLE):\n",
    "\n",
    "Fiducial Localization Error is one of the major sources of inaccuracies in point based spatial registration in image guided systems. FLE is introduced when one set of points does not directly correlate to the set of points in which it is going to map to with the fiducial registration technique. Reducing FLE is crucial to the reduction of FRE, as FLE causes FRE, however, FLE and TRE have no correlation. While there are methods to estimate FLE in a specific instance, this is not valuable information for the purposes of this project, moreover, it is important to note that FLE is distributed normally, independently, isotropically, and identically."
